# learn_chemdb

Some expedition in cheminformatics!

## File explanation

- [codewar_full_chem.py](https://github.com/xueannafang/learn_chemdb/blob/main/codewar_full_chem.py)

This is my attempted test on a level 2 keta on [CodeWar](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a27ca7ab6cfd70f9300007a). The aim is to build an organic molecule based on given length of carbon backbone with branches, followed by a seris of operations, such as atom mutation (e.g., change carbon to sulfur), add atoms/branches, add and remove explicit hydrogen atoms. Basic information of the molecule, such as the molecular weight, molecular formula, can be presented when calling corresponding functions.
